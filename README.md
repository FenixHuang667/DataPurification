# DataPurification

This repository contains the Python code used to generate all experimental results and figures reported in the accompanying paper.

The package includes implementations for computing Variance on datasets, as well as a purification algorithm designed to identify homogeneous data. **All computed results are printed directly to the screen**, and figures or auxiliary outputs (when applicable) are saved to disk.

---


### `data/`
Contains **all datasets used in the paper**, including both real and synthetic data.  
No external data downloads are required to reproduce the experiments.

### `results/`
Stores **all output results and figures** generated by the experiments, corresponding exactly to those reported in the paper.

### `src/`
Contains the core source code, including:
- Functions for computing variance of a dataset
- Implementations of the **purification algorithm** used in the paper

These modules are imported and used by the scripts in the `runs/` directory.

### `runs/`
Contains executable scripts that reproduce individual figures from the paper.  
Each script prints all computed results (e.g., variance values, purification statistics) **directly to the console**, and saves figures or result files to the `results/` directory.

The mapping between scripts and figures is as follows:

- `compute_mislabel_image_variance.py`  
  Reproduces **Figure 3** (variance analysis on mislabeled image data).

- `purify_image.py`  
  Reproduces **Figure 4** (purification on image datasets).

- `compute_synthetic_variance_2spec.py`  
  Reproduces **Figure 5** (variance analysis on two-species synthetic data).

- `compute_synthetic_variance_3spec.py`  
  Reproduces **Figure 7** (variance analysis on three-species synthetic data).

- `purify_synthetic.py`  
  Reproduces **Figures 6 and 8** (purification on synthetic datasets).



## Notes

- All experiments were generated using the exact code provided in this repository.

- All computed statistics and intermediate results are printed to standard output (screen).


## Installation
